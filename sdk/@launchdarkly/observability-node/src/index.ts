/**
 * This is the API reference for the LaunchDarkly Observability Plugin for Node.js.
 *
 * In typical usage you will only need to instantiate the {@link Observability} plugin and pass it to the LaunchDarkly client during initialization.
 *
 * The settings for the observability plugins are defined by the {@link NodeOptions} interface.
 *
 * The {@link LDObserve} singleton is used for manual tracking of events, metrics, and logs.
 * The singleton implements the {@link Observe} interface.
 *
 * # Quick Start
 * ```typescript
 * import { init } from '@launchdarkly/node-server-sdk'
 * import Observability, { LDObserve } from '@launchdarkly/observability'
 *
 * const client = init(
 *   'sdk-key',
 *   {
 *     plugins: [
 *       new Observability(),
 *     ],
 *   },
 * )
 * ```
